# SOTFOV
FOV changer tool for sea of thieves

The 3 branches are 3 different ways to do this, the master branch actually doesnt work right now lmao, the Get-Target-FOV branch is a simpler method at the cost of worse frame drops, and the OneSlider branch is a version that contains only one slider that uses different calculations.

One thing to note, The tool crashes from time to time for an unknown reason. I havnt had the time lately to debug it more and more so maybe some of you can find the cause.


This is a Field Of View changer tool. customizable to a crazy extent.
All weapons have different sliders.

Default.txt file gets preloaded when you inject by running the Loader.exe

Performance mode is for slower PCs or if youre just in a heavy situation with alot of ships.
My PC stutters when alot of stuff is going on so i use this mode always and it solves stuttering completely

Map FOV was a heavily requested feature. no matter what fov you play at, if this is checked, anytime you get on a map it sets your fov to 90 (default for sea of theives)

Checking this box and moving the sliders will link them together so they move in unison.
Useful for if you like the layout of the sliders but want a different FOV
