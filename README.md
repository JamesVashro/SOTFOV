d# SOTFOV
FOV changer tool for sea of thieves

There are 2 branches. The Get-Target-FOV branch is the classic way for my FOV, not complex but may have performance issues in certain situations, and the OneSlider branch is a version that contains only one slider that uses different calculations.

The code in here could use alot of cleaning but works pretty well. Performance could also be improved i think.
The File Browser is not mine, i used this one: https://github.com/gallickgunner/ImGui-Addons


This is a Field Of View changer tool. customizable to a crazy extent.
All weapons have different sliders.

Default.txt file gets preloaded when you inject by running the Loader.exe
You change change this file to whatever you like so you dont have to do anything when you inject.


Performance mode is for slower PCs or if youre just in a heavy situation with alot of ships.
My PC stutters when alot of stuff is going on so i use this mode always and it solves stuttering completely

Map FOV was a heavily requested feature. no matter what fov you play at, if this is checked, anytime you get on a map it sets your fov to 90 (default for sea of theives)

Checking this box and moving the sliders will link them together so they move in unison.
Useful for if you like the layout of the sliders but want a different FOV
