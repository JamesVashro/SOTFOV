# SOTFOV
FOV changer tool for sea of thieves

This version is a much simpler one slider version of the main branch
The calculations for this version are not mine but MrFreaky's on UC. Everyone loved his FOV and asked if i could make one like his, so after he released his calculations i was able to.


Super Simple, One Slider with a checkbox for sprinting FOV (Starts disabled)
Sprinting FOV increases your fov while sprinting
